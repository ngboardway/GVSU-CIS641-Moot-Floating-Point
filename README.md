# Moot Floating Point

Our project is based off the basics of Pac-Man. Your character moves around the maze while trying to not into walls or ghosts. The playerâ€™s goal is to collect all of the dots, which both increase your score and allow you to beat each level. There are special power-ups that allow you to eat the ghosts and temporarily disables them. Our update to the game includes Meme based sprites.
