# 11/28/20 & 12/01/20 Meetings

## Meeting minutes

Team Name: Moot Floating Point

Members present: Jon Griesen, Natalie Boardway, Nick Reitz, Nate Stern

Date: 11/28/20 & 12/01/20

Time: 10:15AM & 08:00PM

Discussion points:

11/28/20
* Main menu interfacing with game, leaderboard, and win condition (saving scores)
    - Win condition (checks visibility of all collectables on board = false).
    - User can toggle from main menu to leaderboard by pressing "L"
    - Space bar will start game, but only from main menu.
* Updated point values; added fruit as new collectable on game board
    - Total points will be 1,400 (tentative)
* Ghost class will continue to be separated from collectables (for incorporation of enemy AI "eventually")
    - Time constraints will likely prevent the addition of moving "enemy" ghosts

12/01/20
* End of the semester deliverables
    - Final project on track to be nearly complete prototype w/ only ghost AI and movement not finished
    - What are the requirements for updating our other deliverables (aka UML diagrams)
        - Will need to follow up with Fredericks and see what his feedback is (will ask him in next class session)

TUESDAY MEETING DETAILS

Goals for next week (include responsibilities):

* Add ability for user to input initials; write score to CSV. [see showSavingScores() --> PacMemeBoard]
* Ensure toString() method of ScoreEntry class accurately displayed on leaderboard.
* Determine whether an additional "view" must be added for pause / quit game functionality (escape).
* Make sure game board "resets" after player has won, or player has quit.
* Meet Saturday for additional coding session from 11AM - 2PM
