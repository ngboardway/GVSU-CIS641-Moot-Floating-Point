Date: 10/13/20

Time: 08:00 PM

Discussion points:

* Discussed tentative class structure for PacMan clone.
* Will most likely be easiest to start with a single class to develop initial gameplay elements.
   - Discussed logistics of initial implementation. Will screen share and work together to develop via Discord.
   - Target meeting time of 12 pm on Saturday 10/17.
* Majority of code structure will likely be in game interface class. Will flesh out additional relevant class structures as project progresses.
* Collectable superclass likely makes sense (Dots, PowerUp, Fruit as subclasses - all inheriting from collectable superclass.
* Discussed GUI implementation, tentative plan is to utilize Graphics2D. Will discuss in greater detail during Saturday meeting.
* Number of classes somewhat tied to complexity

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Review previously shared Java game tutorials/resources in preparation for implementation.
* Meet Saturday 10/17 and begin implementation.
